# JuneTeamProject

This exercise entails the allocation of distinct features to individual circle leads and their respective teams, with the ultimate goal of collaboratively constructing a compact application. Each lead will be responsible for committing their designated segment of the project to GitHub, followed by a comprehensive classroom discussion highlighting both their teams contributions and challenges.
